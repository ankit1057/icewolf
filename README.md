# icewolf

Icewolf is a lightweight easily-configurable web-browser. It is primarly intended to be a starting point for other developers who want to implement something interesting upon it. Icewolf's source code is easy-to-understand and is ready for hacking. We are looking forward to seeing you amazing ideas come true in the form of contributions or forks.

Sincerely yours,
Nick, Greg, Dylan.
